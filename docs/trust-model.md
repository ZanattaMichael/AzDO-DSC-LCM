## The one thing to remember

**`Dsc.PipelineRunner` runs your configuration repository as trusted code.** If you would
not run a script from a source on your build agent as an administrator, do not point the
runner at it.

## Why the configuration is code, not data

Datum merges YAML into per-node configuration, but the runner does not stop at data:

1. `Build-DatumConfiguration` executes a compile step (`DatumConfigurationScriptBlock`)
   that turns the merged configuration into a DSC `Configuration` block and runs it. A
   `Configuration` block is PowerShell — any statement valid in PowerShell is valid inside
   it.
2. Each resource may carry a `preCondition` (formerly `condition`; still accepted as a
   deprecated alias), a `postCondition`, a `preExecutionScript` and a `postExecutionScript`.
   All are compiled to script blocks and evaluated:
   - **`preCondition`** and **`postCondition`** are validated as *side-effect-free
     predicates* before they run (`Assert-SafeConditionExpression`, issue #35). They may
     read variables and properties and compare them, and may call the function-language
     accessors `parameters()`, `variables()`, `reference()`, `equals()` and `not()` (issue
     #57) — an explicit allow-list; every other command invocation, a variable assignment,
     or a method call is still rejected, including a disallowed command nested inside an
     allowed call (e.g. `equals(Get-Item C:\, 'x')`). `postCondition` additionally
     allow-lists `result()` (the `[DscMethodResult]` of the resource just applied) and
     `stopProcessing()` (sets the module-scope flag that stops the rest of the file from
     being processed) — `Assert-SafeConditionExpression -AllowStopProcessing` opts a single
     evaluation into that wider allow-list, and only `postCondition` ever passes that
     switch, so a `preCondition` can never see a result or halt the run.
     `parameters()`/`reference()` are designed to throw on a missing key/reference; a
     condition that throws fails only that resource, the same per-resource try/catch →
     `FAIL` → continue pattern used elsewhere in the resource loop, rather than aborting
     the rest of the file. Both are run with the call operator (`&`) in a child scope, so
     they cannot rewrite the runner's own state other than through the allow-listed
     accessors.
   - **`preExecutionScript`** and **`postExecutionScript`** are imperative by design (they
     exist to call control verbs such as `Stop-TaskProcessing`/`stopProcessing()`) and are
     **not** constrained to a predicate grammar. Because they are unconstrained, a
     configuration may only declare either field when
     `PipelineRunnerSettings.AllowExecutionScripts: true` is set; a pre-parse rule
     (`Test-ExecutionScriptsAllowed`) rejects the whole run, naming every offending
     resource, when the gate is off. This is an explicit, all-or-nothing opt-in for the
     run — it is not a per-resource sandbox, and once enabled these scripts run with the
     same trust as the rest of the configuration. They run in a child scope, so they
     cannot silently rewrite the runner's locals, but they can execute arbitrary code.
3. The resources themselves are applied by the DSC engine (DSC v2 `Invoke-DscResource` or
   DSC v3 `dsc`), which runs whatever the resource implementation does — locally by
   default, or against a `target`'s `CimSession`/`PSSession` when the resource (or the
   run's default) names a non-`Local` target (see "Remote targets and credentials" below).

## The boundary

| Boundary | Trusted side | Untrusted side |
|---|---|---|
| Configuration repository | Everything in it runs as code | — there is no untrusted side |
| Clone transport | HTTPS/SSH to a verified host | Plaintext HTTP — refused, not merely discouraged |
| Runner process | Runs configuration + resources | — |
| Remote target (`WinRM`/`SSH`) | The `ComputerName` and credential named by the configuration | Any host reachable from the build agent — the configuration decides which |

There is deliberately no "untrusted configuration" mode. Treat the configuration
repository as part of the trusted computing base.

## What the runner enforces

The clone is the one edge of this boundary the runner can defend on its own, and it does so
unconditionally — there is no setting that relaxes any of it:

| Control | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Transport | `https`, `ssh` and SCP-style `git@host:path` only. A plain `http://` URL throws a terminating error naming the scheme. |
| Revision pinning | `-ConfigurationRevision` checks out a branch, tag or commit. A full 40-character SHA is verified against the clone's resolved `HEAD`; a mismatch fails the run. |
| Provenance in the log | The resolved `HEAD` SHA is written to the information stream on every clone, so the pipeline log records the commit that actually ran. |
| Credential handling | Tokens are held as `[SecureString]` and injected as an HTTP `Authorization` header through git's environment-based configuration, never on the process command line, and redacted from error text. |
| Temporary directories | Clones and fallback cache directories are created owner-only (`0700` on Unix, a single full-control ACE on Windows) and removed in a `finally`, so they do not survive a failed run. Only directories the runner created are removed — a caller-supplied path is never deleted. `-KeepTemporaryDirectory` opts out for debugging. |

This narrows the *transport*, not the boundary itself: a configuration delivered intact over
a verified channel still runs as fully-trusted code.

## Operational controls

- **Branch protection & required reviews** on the configuration repository, matching (or
  exceeding) the controls on the runner's own source.
- **Signed commits** where your platform supports enforcing them.
- **Scoped pipeline triggers** — restrict who can run the pipeline and from which branches.
- **Verified clone transport** — HTTPS or SSH with known-host verification. The runner
  already refuses anything else; keep host verification configured on the agent so the
  remote's identity is checked as well as its scheme.
- **Pin the revision** — pass `-ConfigurationRevision`, ideally a full commit SHA, so a push
  to the tracked branch cannot change what a run applies between review and execution.
- **Least privilege** on the agent identity and on any managed-node credentials.

When the configuration source is a remote URL, `Build-DatumConfiguration` emits a
`Write-Warning` at the start of compilation restating this requirement, so it is visible in
the pipeline log.

## Remote targets and credentials

Two action hooks extend the boundary above from the build agent to the systems it manages:

- **`Target`** (`Local`, `WinRM`, `SSH`) decides where a resource's DSC engine call runs.
  `Local` is a no-op (the resource runs in the runner's own process, as before). `WinRM`
  opens a `New-CimSession`/`New-PSSession` pair against `Context.ComputerName`; `SSH` opens
  a `New-PSSession -SSHTransport` pair and fails fast if paired with the DSC v2 engine
  (SSH remoting requires DSC v3). Either way, a resource's `target.action` (or the run's
  `PipelineRunnerSettings.Target` default) names an arbitrary reachable host, so the
  "configuration repository is trusted code" boundary now extends over the network to
  every host the build agent can reach and has credentials for. Sessions are cached per
  `(target action, computer name, credential)` for the run and always closed in a
  `finally` block, so a failed or interrupted run does not leak an open remote session.
- **`Credential`** (`Environment`, `Static`, `SecretManagement`) resolves the
  `[PSCredential]` used for a `target` connection or injected into a resource's
  `resourceCredential` property:
  - `Environment` (default) reads a username/password pair from two named environment
    variables on the build agent — the secret value itself never appears in the
    configuration repository, only the names of the variables that hold it.
  - `Static` takes a plain-text or securestring password inline in the configuration and
    is intended for local development and testing only; every use emits a `Write-Warning`
    so it is visible in pipeline logs, and a plain-text value committed to the repository
    is exposed to anyone with read access to that repository's history.
  - `SecretManagement` resolves a named secret from a registered
    `Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement` vault via `Get-Secret`, delegating the
    secret's storage, access control and rotation entirely to that vault. The runner
    holds the resolved value only as an in-memory `[PSCredential]` for the duration of
    the connection or resource application; it is not logged, cached to disk, or written
    to the compiled configuration.

None of this narrows the core boundary — a configuration that can name a `target` and a
`Credential` action could always execute code with equivalent effect through the resources
it already declares. It documents where that trust now reaches, so operators can scope
network access and credential availability on the build agent accordingly.

## Future hardening (tracked)

- AST-based allow-listing of permitted DSC resource types.
- Executing the compile step under
  `[System.Management.Automation.SessionState]::LanguageMode = 'ConstrainedLanguage'`.

These would narrow the boundary but cannot remove it: a configuration that is allowed to
declare resources is, by construction, allowed to change the state those resources manage.
