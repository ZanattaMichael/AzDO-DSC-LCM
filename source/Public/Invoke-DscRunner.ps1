.SYNOPSIS
Provider-agnostic entry point for the DSC pipeline runner.

.DESCRIPTION
Invoke-DscRunner drives the runner without any hard dependency on Azure DevOps. It
composes three loader-driven lifecycle actions (see Invoke-Action):

  1. Source  — resolve the configuration to a local directory (Local, Git, or a
               custom drop-in / inline scriptblock).
  2. Connect — establish any auth/session before evaluation (None by default,
               AzureDevOps, or a custom drop-in / inline scriptblock).
  3. Compile Datum and run Start-DscRunner over each compiled configuration file.

Every seam is selectable by name (a file under Actions/<Hook>/) or overridden with an
inline [scriptblock], so third parties can plug in bespoke sources and auth providers
without forking the module.

.PARAMETER Source
Name of the Source action (a file under Actions/Source/). Default: 'Local'.

.PARAMETER SourceAction
Inline Source action scriptblock. Takes precedence over -Source.

.PARAMETER SourceContext
Hashtable passed to the Source action (for example @{ Url = ... } for Git or
@{ Path = ... } for Local). If -ConfigurationSourcePath is supplied it is merged in
as the 'Path' (and, for Git, 'Url') key.

.PARAMETER ConfigurationSourcePath
Convenience: a local directory or git URL. Populates the Source context.

.PARAMETER ConfigurationRevision
Convenience: the branch, tag, or commit to pin a remote configuration to. Populates the
Source context's 'Revision' key, which the Git source action passes to Clone-Repository.
Supplying a full 40-character commit SHA makes the pin exact - the clone's HEAD is verified
against it. Ignored by source actions that do not clone.

.PARAMETER Connect
Name of the Connect action (a file under Actions/Connect/). Default: 'None'.

.PARAMETER ConnectAction
Inline Connect action scriptblock. Takes precedence over -Connect.

.PARAMETER ConnectContext
Hashtable passed to the Connect action.

.PARAMETER CacheDirectory
Directory Datum compiles into. When omitted, the generic PIPELINERUNNER_CACHE_DIRECTORY
environment variable is used (with AZDODSC_CACHE_DIRECTORY honoured as a back-compat
alias); failing that, a new temporary directory is created. Replaces the old
AZDODSC_CACHE_DIRECTORY hard requirement.

.PARAMETER Mode
'Test' (default) or 'Set'.

.PARAMETER ReportPath
Optional directory to write the per-configuration CSV report into.

.PARAMETER Engine
Name of the execution engine action (a file under Actions/Engine/). 'DscV2' (default)
wraps Invoke-DscResource; 'DscV3' drives dsc.exe. 'Auto' opts in to detection, choosing
DscV3 when the dsc executable is present (or the version hint asks for it) and DscV2
otherwise. When -Engine is not passed explicitly, the configuration's
PipelineRunnerSettings drive selection: an 'Engine' key names the engine, otherwise the
back-compat 'DSCResourceVersion' major version maps (2.x -> DscV2, 3.x -> DscV3).

.PARAMETER EngineVersion
Optional resource version hint used to bias 'Auto' engine selection by major version
(major >= 3 selects DscV3, major 2 selects DscV2). Ignored unless -Engine is 'Auto'.

.PARAMETER EngineAction
Inline engine scriptblock. Takes precedence over -Engine.

.PARAMETER KeepTemporaryDirectory
Leave any temporary directory the runner created (a clone, or a fallback cache directory)
on disk after the run instead of deleting it. Useful when debugging a compile failure.
Directories supplied by the caller are never deleted, with or without this switch.

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-DscRunner -ConfigurationSourcePath 'C:\config' -Mode Test
Runs against a local directory with no authentication (Source: Local, Connect: None).

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-DscRunner -Source Git -SourceContext @{ Url = $repo; Token = $pat } `
                 -Connect AzureDevOps -ConnectContext @{ OrganizationName = 'MyOrg'; AuthenticationType = 'PAT'; PATToken = $pat }

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-DscRunner -ConfigurationSourcePath 'C:\config' -ConnectAction {
    param($Context) Connect-MyPlatform -Token $Context.Token
}
