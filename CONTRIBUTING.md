# Contributing to Dsc.PipelineRunner

Thanks for contributing. This document describes the checks a change must pass and how to
run them locally before opening a pull request.

## Repository layout

- `source/` — the module source. `Private/`, `Public/`, and `Classes/` are merged into the
  built module by [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler)/ModuleBuilder; the compiled
  output lands under `Output/`.
- `Pipeline Rules/` and `Actions/` — pipeline-rule and action scripts that ship alongside the
  module and are covered by the same tests and lint gate.
- `Tests/PipelineRunner/` — the Pester suite. `Tests/TestHelpers/CommonTestFunctions.psm1`
  provides `Get-FunctionPath` and sets `$Global:RepositoryRoot` / `$Global:TestPaths`.

## Running the checks locally

You need PowerShell 7+ with the module dependencies installed:

```powershell
Install-Module Datum, Datum.InvokeCommand, powershell-yaml, PSDesiredStateConfiguration, PSScriptAnalyzer -Force
```

### Tests and code coverage

```powershell
. .\tests.ps1
```

`tests.ps1` runs the full Pester suite with code coverage enabled. It sets
`Run.Exit = $true`, so the process exits non-zero when any test fails, and enforces a minimum
line-coverage floor via `CodeCoverage.CoveragePercentTarget`. Keep new code covered — a drop
below the floor fails the build.

### Static analysis (lint)

```powershell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path source, 'Pipeline Rules', Actions -Recurse
```

The CI lint gate fails only on **Error**-severity findings (the parse/correctness class).
Warnings are surfaced for review but do not block. All findings are uploaded to the
repository's **Security → Code scanning** tab as SARIF.

## Continuous integration

Every push and pull request runs these GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Check | What it enforces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/CodeCoverage.yml` | **build** | Guards against reintroduced `LCM` naming, then runs `tests.ps1` (tests + coverage floor). |
| `.github/workflows/Lint.yml` | **Lint (PSScriptAnalyzer)** | Static analysis; fails on Error-severity findings; uploads SARIF. |
| `.github/workflows/DscV3-HostedAgent.yml` | **DSC v3 engine on Ubuntu**, **Build DSC v3 agent image** | Exercises the DSC v3 engine path and image build. |
| `.github/workflows/DscV2-SelfHosted.yml` | **DSC v2 Self-Hosted Agent** | Drives a real class-based resource through `Invoke-DscResource` on a Windows self-hosted runner. |
| `.github/workflows/AzureDevOps-SelfHosted.yml` | **Azure DevOps Real Lifecycle Self-Hosted** | End-to-end Azure DevOps lifecycle against a real organization, DSC v2 engine. |
| `.github/workflows/AzureDevOpsV3-SelfHosted.yml` | **Azure DevOps Real Lifecycle DSC v3 Self-Hosted** | The same lifecycle through the DSC v3 engine. |

A pull request should be green on all of the above before it is reviewed.

### Which tests run where

`tests.ps1` — the hosted `build` gate — excludes the `Integration`, `DscV2SelfHosted`,
`AzureDevOpsSelfHosted` and `AzureDevOpsV3SelfHosted` tags. Those suites need a real DSC
engine, a real resource, or a real Azure DevOps organization, so they run only on the
self-hosted workflows above, which select them by tag or by path.

This split matters when you touch anything `Start-DscRunner` calls. The integration suites
**dot-source the runner's collaborators individually rather than importing the built
module**, so a new helper in that call chain has to be added to each suite's `BeforeAll` as
well — otherwise the hosted gate stays green and the self-hosted jobs fail with
`CommandNotFoundException`.

## Releasing

Releases are tag-driven (`.github/workflows/Release.yml`). Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag — or
`vX.Y.Z-preview0001` for a prerelease — validates that the tag is well-formed and points at
a commit contained in `main`, runs the full CI suite as a release gate by reusing the
workflows above, and publishes to the GitHub Release and the PowerShell Gallery. The version
comes from the tag and is baked into the manifest at build time, so **do not hand-edit
`ModuleVersion`** in `source/Dsc.PipelineRunner.psd1`. Record user-visible changes under
`[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` instead, and note there when a change requires a major bump.

## Not enforced in this repository

Two items commonly associated with a CI hardening pass are intentionally **not** part of this
repo's code:

- **Branch protection / required status checks.** These are configured by a repository
  administrator under *Settings → Branches*, not in version-controlled files. Maintainers
  should require the `build` and `Lint (PSScriptAnalyzer)` checks on the default branch and
  require pull-request review before merge.
- **A `build.ps1` bootstrap.** The project drives CI directly through `tests.ps1` rather than a
  full Sampler `build.ps1` bootstrap. Introducing the Sampler build pipeline is a larger change
  tracked separately; until then, `tests.ps1` is the entry point CI and contributors use.

## Security

Configuration content executed by the runner is **trusted code** — there is no sandbox. Before
changing anything that loads or evaluates configuration, read [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and
[`docs/trust-model.md`](docs/trust-model.md).
